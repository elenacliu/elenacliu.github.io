	abstract = {Robotic research encounters a significant hurdle when it comes to the intricate task of grasping objects that come in various shapes, materials, and textures. Unlike many prior investigations that heavily leaned on specialized point-cloud cameras or abundant RGB visual data to gather 3D insights for object-grasping missions, this paper introduces a pioneering approach called RGBGrasp. This method depends on a limited set of RGB views to perceive the 3D surroundings containing transparent and specular objects and achieve accurate grasping. Our method utilizes pre-trained depth prediction models to establish geometry constraints, enabling precise 3D structure estimation, even under limited view conditions. Finally, we integrate hash encoding and a proposal sampler strategy to significantly accelerate the 3D reconstruction process. These innovations significantly enhance the adaptability and effectiveness of our algorithm in real-world scenarios. Through comprehensive experimental validation, we demonstrate that RGBGrasp achieves remarkable success across a wide spectrum of object-grasping scenarios, establishing it as a promising solution for real-world robotic manipulation tasks. The demo of our method can be found on: https://sites.google.com/view/rgbgrasp},

	abstract = {Face recognition is a prevailing authentication solution in numerous biometric applications. Physical adversarial attacks, as an important surrogate, can identify the weaknesses of face recognition systems and evaluate their robustness before deployed. However, most existing physical attacks are either detectable readily or ineffective against commercial recognition systems. The goal of this work is to develop a more reliable technique that can carry out an endto-end evaluation of adversarial robustness for commercial systems. It requires that this technique can simultaneously deceive black-box recognition models and evade defensive mechanisms. To fulfill this, we design adversarial textured 3D meshes (AT3D) with an elaborate topology on a human face, which can be 3D-printed and pasted on the attackerâ€™s face to evade the defenses. However, the mesh-based optimization regime calculates gradients in high-dimensional mesh space, and can be trapped into local optima with unsatisfactory transferability. To deviate from the mesh-based space, we propose to perturb the low-dimensional coefficient space based on 3D Morphable Model, which significantly improves black-box transferability meanwhile enjoying faster search efficiency and better visual quality. Extensive experiments in digital and physical scenarios show that our method effectively explores the security vulnerabilities of multiple popular commercial services, including three recognition APIs, four anti-spoofing APIs, two prevailing mobile phones and two automated access control systems.},
