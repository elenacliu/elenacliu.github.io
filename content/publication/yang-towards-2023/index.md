abstract: Face recognition is a prevailing authentication solution in numerous biometric
  applications. Physical adversarial attacks, as an important surrogate, can identify
  the weaknesses of face recognition systems and evaluate their robustness before
  deployed. However, most existing physical attacks are either detectable readily
  or ineffective against commercial recognition systems. The goal of this work is
  to develop a more reliable technique that can carry out an endto-end evaluation
  of adversarial robustness for commercial systems. It requires that this technique
  can simultaneously deceive black-box recognition models and evade defensive mechanisms.
  To fulfill this, we design adversarial textured 3D meshes (AT3D) with an elaborate
  topology on a human face, which can be 3D-printed and pasted on the attackerâ€™s face
  to evade the defenses. However, the mesh-based optimization regime calculates gradients
  in high-dimensional mesh space, and can be trapped into local optima with unsatisfactory
  transferability. To deviate from the mesh-based space, we propose to perturb the
  low-dimensional coefficient space based on 3D Morphable Model, which significantly
  improves black-box transferability meanwhile enjoying faster search efficiency and
  better visual quality. Extensive experiments in digital and physical scenarios show
  that our method effectively explores the security vulnerabilities of multiple popular
  commercial services, including three recognition APIs, four anti-spoofing APIs,
  two prevailing mobile phones and two automated access control systems.
